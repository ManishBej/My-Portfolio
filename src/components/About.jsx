      As a tenacious and resourceful individual, I am passionate about developing cutting-edge solutions at the intersection of full-stack development and artificial intelligence. Currently pursuing my Bachelorâ€™s in Information Technology, I have a strong foundation in technologies such as React, Next.js, FastAPI, Flask, Django, and MongoDB, complemented by hands-on experience with Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Express, and Node.js. Alongside my full-stack development skills, I am equally focused on advancing my knowledge in AI, specifically in Generative AI model development using PyTorch, LLMs, NLP, RAG, and vector databases. I thrive in dynamic environments that challenge my problem-solving abilities and allow me to continuously grow as a professional. My experience working with industry tools like SAP ERP during my internship at Indian Oil Corporation has equipped me with the technical and interpersonal skills to excel in team-oriented settings. A self-motivated and data-driven individual, I am eager to contribute to innovative projects as a Full-Stack Developer and AI Engineer, leveraging my diverse skill set to deliver impactful and scalable solutions.
